Technologies used for CSVapp:
 - Python 3
     - csv module (built-in)
     - PySimpleGUI package

In order to run the CSVapp, run the CSVapp.py file. A window should appear where you can then intereact with the application.

Technologies used for CSVlibrary:
 - Python 3
     - csv module (built-in)

In order to run the CSVlibrary application independently from the CSVapp, it will run as a command line system by running CSVlibrary.py, and having an existing CSV file in the same directory.

I created this application in Visual Studio Code
